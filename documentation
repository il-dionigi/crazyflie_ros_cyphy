Ros stuff:
To get ros installed, follow the turotials from ros kinetic, and on whoenigs paper (link)[http://act.usc.edu/publications/Hoenig_Springer_ROS2017.pdf]
After installation, remember to catkin_make in the crazyflie_ws to build the code
If you change C code, you must catkin_make. If you change python code or launch files, you don't have To
If you create a new python file, you must chmod it to have execute permission
If you have a libusb error, try add a rule to your rules.d file
If you get a what() timeout error, this usually means the connection failed because it could not find
the drone, you must change the address in the launch file
To run a launch file, make sure roscore is running (roscore in terminal), then you can roslaunch <dir> <file>
e.g. roslaunch crazyflie_demo interface.launch

About ros topics: 
Ros uses topics to manage shared data; one 'node' or process can publish data as a msg to a topic,
then another node can get that data by subscribing. An example of a subscriber/publisher can be found in interface.py,
It subscribes to the location data that the server gets from the drone, and it publishes data the server should send

About the code:
the launch files uses crazyflie_add to add the crazyflie based on its uri and then calls crazyflie_server
and the python script. The server is in direct communication with the drone; it gets messages to send based on the
subscribed topics, i.e. based on which topic the python code publishes to. 

Other useful ros commands:
rosrun crazyflie_tools <tool> (e.g. scan, which scans)
rostopic echo <topic> (echo's all data published to topic)
rostopic list -v (lists all topics + how many subscribers/publishers)
rostopic info <topic> (lists which nodes are published/subscribed)
rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph (shows a graph of publishers and subcribers, can be a little misleading at times)

To get wolfssl working:
git clone https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl
cd wolfSSL
(sudo apt-get install autoconf)
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-pwdbased
make
make check
sudo make install
-Note that the ROS.cmake and CMake.cmake are edited to include wolfssl
